<p>Easily switch between themes in Firefox and Thunderbird. This extension
allows you to switch between themes via keyboard combinations or every N
minutes. It also allows one to specify switching to a random next theme.
Autoswitching and having Thematic on the tools menu is not supported in
Thunderbird.</p>

<li>https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/thematic/</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a re-implementation of personaswitcher that was developed for Firefox 4.</p>
<p>For Thunderbird, there are at least two way to use Firefox's themes.</p>
<h2>First way</h2>
<p>Install https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-us/thunderbird/addon/browseintab/ in
Thunderbird and then surf to the Firefix theme URL you like. It will say
&quot;Download Firefox&quot; but you don't need to do that. Instead, click on
&quot;Download file&quot;. Thunderbird will automagically recognize the file as a
theme and install it for you.</p>

<p>Really, it would be nice the Thunderbird to know to look for Firefox themes
automatically. Maybe I'll get around to that some day.</p>
<h2>Second way</h2>
<p>Another approach is to find the FireFox theme you want and right-click
on the Install Theme. Choose Copy Link and use another program to download
the file locally. Curl, wget, or even another browser will do the trick.</p>

<p>In Thunderbird, go to Tools -&gt; Extensions and Themes. Click the settings
icon and choose Install Add-on From File...</p>

<p>Click on the .xpi you downloaded and you should be good to go. It appears
that Thunderbird currently doesn't notify Thematic of the new theme, so a
restart is in order.</p></article>
